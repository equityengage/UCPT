# UCPT 10.1 Final Initial Release
Universal Community Planning Tool

The Universal Community Planning Tool (UCPT) is a population health planning framework that guides communities in implementing a digital collaborative to track their community's planning processes.

The WordPress plug-ins contained within this repository are working, deployable examples of code that can be implemented to jumpstart digital community planning collaboratives and expand existing digital LHD (Local Health Department) digital engagement strategies.

The UCPT premade plug-ins require a WordPress/BuddyPress installation, and step-by-step implementation instructions can be found on EquityEngage.com.

This project is coordinated by the Garrett County Health Department, with support from PHNCI, a division of PHAB, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as a emerging innovation in Public Health.
